/**
This is an example CSS file that can be used to style the Component Options 
window inside SketchUp. To utilize this example file, go through the following 
steps. (Note that you must use SketchUp Pro to follow these instructions. 
SketchUp Free does not contain the features that you need to attach CSS files.)

THE PROCESS:

1. Place your .css file in the SAME FOLDER as your .skp file.
2. Inside SketchUp, use the Component Attributes window to add a CSSURL to
   the component you would like to style. Enter the file name of the .css as 
   your CSSURL.
3. Open the Component Options panel to see your styled window. Make changes
   to the CSS and refresh the dialog until you are satisfied.
4. Once you are done you can upload your .css file to a web server and
   enter its absolute URL into the CSSURL attribute.

A DETAILED EXAMPLE:

Let's say you have a file called kitchen.skp that contains a Sink component.
You would like to have a Component Options window for this sink that contains
your company logo and colors.

To start, make a copy of this CSS file (the one you're reading) and save it as 
sink.css in the same folder as kitchen.skp. This puts the CSS file in a spot
where SketchUp can find it.

Next, we need to tell the component to look for your new CSS file. Open 
kitchen.skp inside SketchUp Pro. Right click on your sink, and select 
Dynamic Components > Component Attributes. This opens the Component Attrubutes
dialog that will allow us to hook up to our CSS file.

Inside the Component Attributes dialog, you should see an outliner tree
with your sink as the top element. Uncollapse the attribute tree beneath your
sink, and then click the "Add Attribute" link.

At this point, a list of all the reserved attributes will appear. At the bottom
of this list, select "CSSURL", which will add an attribute with that name to
your sink. Then double click on its value cell, type "sink.css", and press 
enter. At this point your sink has been attached to sink.css.

Right click on your sink, and select Dynamic Components > Component Attributes.
At this point, the Component Attributes dialog is being styled by your sink.css.
Let's make a change to the file to confirm this. Try changing "font-size: 20px;"
to "font-size: 40px;" inside the #config-head style.

To see your new, larger font, close and reopen the Component Options window. If
your title text size is twice as large, you've done everything right. You can
now make whatever changes you want to sink.css to display your company colors
and logo. (There are many excellent references on the web for understanding CSS.
