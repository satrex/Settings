# This file includes a number of examples of how to use the Ruby interface
# to access a SketchUp model and perform various kinds of operations.

# To test the examples you must first load the files.
# There are two ways that you can do this.

# The first way is to manually load it from the Ruby console.  You can show
# the Ruby console by selecting View/Ruby Console. (This is actually added
# to the View menu when the Ruby script sketchup.rb is loaded.)  In the
# Ruby console, type the following line:
# load 'examples/examples.rb'
# If there are no syntax errors in the file, it will display "true" in the
# Ruby console.  Otherwise it will show error messages and information about
# the line on which errors were found.

# The second way to load this file is to copy it into the SketchUp plugins
# directory.  Any files with the extension .rb that are in the plugins
# directory are automatically loaded when you start SketchUp.

# The following line includes some common useful scripts.  The file
# sketchup.rb is automatically put in the SketchUp plugins directory
# when SketchUp is installed, so it should always get automatically
# loaded anyway, but it is good practice to explicitly require any
# files that you have dependencies on to make sure that they are loaded.
require 'sketchup.rb'
require 'extensions.rb'
require 'LangHandler.rb'
